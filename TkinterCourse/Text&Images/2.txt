Hummingbirds are birds native to the Americas and constituting the biological family Trochilidae. They are the smallest
of birds, most species measuring 7.5–13 cm (3–5 in) in length. The smallest extant hummingbird species is the
5 cm (2.0 in) bee hummingbird, which weighs less than 2.0 g (0.07 oz). The largest hummingbird species is the
23 cm (9.1 in) giant hummingbird, weighing 18–24 g (0.63–0.85 oz).

They are known as hummingbirds because of the humming sound created by their beating wings, which flap at high
frequencies audible to humans. They hover in mid-air at rapid wing-flapping rates, which vary from around 12 beats per
second in the largest species, to in excess of 80 in some of the smallest.
