The Sundarbans is a mangrove area in the delta formed by the confluence of the Ganges, Brahmaputra and Meghna Rivers
in the Bay of Bengal. It spans from the Hooghly River in India's state of West Bengal to the Baleswar River in
Bangladesh. It comprises closed and open mangrove forests, land used for agricultural purpose, mudflats and barren land,
 and is intersected by multiple tidal streams and channels. Four protected areas in the Sundarbans are enlisted as
 UNESCO World Heritage Sites, viz. Sundarbans National Park, Sundarbans West, Sundarbans South and Sundarbans East
  Wildlife Sanctuaries. Despite these protections, the Indian Sundarbans were considered endangered in a 2020 assessment
   under the IUCN Red List of Ecosystems framework.
