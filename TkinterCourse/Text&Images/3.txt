Genghis Khan was the founder and first Great Khan (Emperor) of the Mongol Empire, which became the largest contiguous
 empire in history after his death. He came to power by uniting many of the nomadic tribes of Northeast Asia.
 Due to his exceptional military successes, Genghis Khan is often considered to be the greatest conqueror of all time.
